# Digital-Watermarking-and-Caption-Generator
This is my major project during my BE degree in Computer Technology 
This project is to watermark or generate captions for the image provided by admin using Python , Deep Learning
and NLP. Using AES algorithm , encryption and decryption of the image will be performed to provide secured
content to the user. And It categorizes images using English keywords , trains a CNN classifier on imagenet ,
utilizes an LSTM model for caption generation and shows the difference of output between CNN , LSTM and Kmeans algorithm. It also has the feature to generate live video caption.
